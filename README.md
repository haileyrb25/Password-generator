# Hailey Bates Password-generator

For this repo, we have a password generator that can be used to make a serious of unique characters. With this code, we were given starter code to work on and went through extensive practice to get the prompt and alert windows to come up. The overall purpose of this application is to help users generate a random password based on whichever criteria they would like. This could range from upper case or lower case letters, numbers, or special characters. It can also range between 8-128 characters, making it nearly impossible to get the same code again. Happy generating!
